Examples
========

Complete worked examples for common soil spectroscopy tasks.

.. note::
   Example Jupyter notebooks are available in the `examples/ directory <https://github.com/yourusername/soilspec/tree/main/examples>`_ of the repository.

Coming Soon
-----------

Examples under development:

* **SOC Prediction from OSSL**: Complete workflow using Open Soil Spectral Library data
* **Transfer Learning with MBL**: Applying calibrations across instruments
* **Multi-Property Prediction**: Predicting SOC, clay, N simultaneously with constraints
* **Feature Importance**: Interpreting Cubist rules in chemical context
* **Comparison Study**: Benchmarking MBL vs Cubist vs CNN
* **Custom Spectral Library**: Building and using your own calibration library

For now, see :doc:`quickstart` for basic usage patterns.
