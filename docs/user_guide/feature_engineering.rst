Feature Engineering Guide
=========================

Physics-informed feature extraction for soil spectroscopy. See :doc:`../api/features` for detailed API documentation.

Why Feature Engineering?
-------------------------

Instead of using all 1801 wavelengths:

* **Reduce overfitting**: ~50 features vs 1801 wavelengths
* **Faster training**: 10-50x speedup
* **Interpretability**: Features have chemical meaning
* **Transfer learning**: More robust across instruments

See :doc:`../api/features` for complete documentation and scientific background.
